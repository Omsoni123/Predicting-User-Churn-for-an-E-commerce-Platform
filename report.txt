Approach:

Loaded the dataset and performed preprocessing, including handling missing values, data formatting, and feature scaling.
Engineered new features like user activity metrics and defined churn based on inactivity thresholds.
Built two models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
Evaluated models using metrics such as classification reports, ROC-AUC scores, and confusion matrices.
Used SHAP values and feature importance to interpret model behavior.
Formulated actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

Final Scores:
Logistic Regression:

ROC-AUC: [0.5412077936171024]
Accuracy: [ 0.80 ]

Random Forest:

ROC-AUC: [0.5670044525153204]
Accuracy: [ 0.78 ]


Recommendations:
1. By analyzing feature importance from both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, I identified key drivers of churn, such as users with lower purchase counts and reduced total spend.
2. To address this, targeted marketing campaigns can be designed to re-engage users who exhibit early signs of churn, like those with high event activity but no purchases.
3. Offering loyalty programs or providing special discounts could encourage at-risk users to make purchases and improve retention.
4. Regular monitoring of user activity is essential, and the churn threshold (e.g., 30 days) should be adjusted to reflect changing business needs and user behavior.
5. Personalized product recommendations and incentive-based strategies can also help retain users by aligning with their preferences.
6. SHAP values and partial dependence plots are extremely helpful in understanding feature contributions, enabling the creation of effective, actionable strategies for reducing churn
